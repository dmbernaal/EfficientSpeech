# Efficientspeech 
This repo is just my attempt at learning how Efficientspeech works following the repo: [https://github.com/roatienza/efficientspeech/blob/main/demo.py]

## Install
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## w/ llama or other LLMs?
If I get this working ill keep pushing to this to have this working with Language models to have 'coversations' with the models. However, we may also need to implement whisper to get the full experience
